5.Consider a program that uses the fork() system call to create a child process. Initially, the parent process has a variable x 
with a value of 5. After forking, both the parent and child processes increment the value of x by 1. 
What will be the final values of x in the parent and child processes after the fork() call?

-> Initially the parent and child processes performs independently where both has the 5 process.
After the forking, both the parent and child processes are incremented by 1 then final values of x variable will be the 6 parent processes
and 6 child processes.

Difficulties -
1. I have faced the some issues when solving the fork with child and parent processes as i have get to know the fork concept but i did not understand the exactly what question want to say about that.But as per my knowledge i have added the 5 with 1 and given as 6 for the both parent and child processes.
