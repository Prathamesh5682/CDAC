    <p id="text">It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life.
        When a person leads a disciplined life, they set an easy path to success.
        They will develop an approach to happiness and a beautiful future ahead.
        Being disciplined is the practice of having a scheduled daily routine which helps an individual
        to be punctual and hard-working. An individual is taught what being disciplined means
        from the time they are young.Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of
        a disciplined life make it a worthwhile endeavour.
