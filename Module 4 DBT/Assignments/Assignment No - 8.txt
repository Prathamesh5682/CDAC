table that will produce the order number, the salesperson number, and the amount 
of the salesperson’s commission for that order.
-->	select onum, snum, amt, (amt * 0.12) + 100  as comm from orders order by 1;

   	CONCAT('For the city : ',city,' the highest rating is : ',MAX(RATING)) AS RESULT
   	FROM CUSTOMERS

4) Write a query that totals the orders for each day and places the results in 
descending order.

    	group by odate
    	order by totals desc;
