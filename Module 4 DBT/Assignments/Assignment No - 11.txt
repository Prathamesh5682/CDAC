1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named 
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).
--> select cname, onum, amt,odate from orders as o,customers as c where o.cnum = c.cnum
    -> and c.cname = 'Cisneros';

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have 
above-average orders.
--> select cname , rating from orders as o join customers as c on o.cnum = c.cnum
    -> where o.amt > (select avg(amt) from orders);

3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for 
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.
--> select o.Snum,Sname , sum(amt) as total_amt from orders o  join salespeople s on o.snum = s.snum
    -> group by s.sname,s.snum having total_amt > (select max(amt) from orders);
